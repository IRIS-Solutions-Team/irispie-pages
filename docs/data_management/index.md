:octicons-database-24: Data management tools
=============================================

IrisPie implements the following basic types of objects to support and
streamline data management in modeling tasks:

* [`Databox`](databoxes.md) objects for unstructured data storage,

* Time [`Series`](time_series.md) objects for time series manipulation,

* Time [`Period`](periods.md) objects for time period manipulation and
  arithmetic,

* Time [`Span`](spans.md) objects for spans of multiple time periods,

* Time [`Frequency`](frequencies.md) enumeration for user convenience of
  referring to time frequencies.


While similar functionality is available in other third-party packages or
in standard Python libraries, the IrisPie implementation is specifically
geared towards flexible and fluid use with macroeconomic and financial
data.
