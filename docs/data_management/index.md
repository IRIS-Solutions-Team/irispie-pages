# :octicons-database-24: Data management tools

Iris Pie implements three key types of objects to facilitate data
management:

* [`Databox`](databoxes.md) (unstructured data store) objects,

* [`Series`](time_series.md) (time series) objects,

* [`Daters`](dates.md) (dates),


While similar functionality is available in other third-party
packages or even in standard Python libraries, the Iris Pie implementation
is specifically geared towards flexible and fluid use with
macroeconomic and financial data.
