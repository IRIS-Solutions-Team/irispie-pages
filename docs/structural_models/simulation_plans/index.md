Dynamic simulation plans
=========================

Dynamic simulation plans are used to set up assumptions about
[`Simultaneous`](../simultaneous_models/index.md) or
[`Sequential`](../sequential_models/index.md) model simulations:

* what variables to exogenize in what periods
* what shocks to endogenized in what periods (`Simultaneous` models only)
* what shocks to consider anticipated or unanticipated in what periods

The plans only contain meta information, not any actual data. The actual
data (the exogenized data points, the values of shocks) need to be included
in the input databox.
