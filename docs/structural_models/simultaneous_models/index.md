`Simultaneous` models
======================

`Simultaneous` models are systems of interdependent equations that can only
be simulated as a whole in general (as opposed to equation by equatio). The
model objects are built from model source code (a single text file, a
collection of multiple files, or a text string) written using
[the model source language](../model_language.md).
